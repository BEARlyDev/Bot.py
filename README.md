# The Python 'chat bot'
####### *Disclaimer:*  This is not a chat bot in it's full capability and is just a trial of the data-structures and algorithms I have learnt.

As far as I can simplify it. This is a use of some of the more common features of Python's many data-structures in order to build a program that has set answers to user question and as an added bonus lets the user train it by supplying it with sample 'ideal' answers to it's questions.

#### What this repo contains
This repo has 6 files along with the README you are viewing. They are:
* *bot.py :* The file which contains the defintion of the bot class.
* *main.py :* The file which initializes an object of the bot class and uses it to run a chat-bot interface.
* *memory.db :* The memory of all questions and their assosciated answers, as accessed by the bot class using python file management.
* *joke.db :* The list of jokes which can be accessed by the joke function, defined in bot.py.
* *trivia.db :* A list of facts accessible to the trivia function for quiz time, defined in bot.py.
* *Screenshot.png :* The ideal situation this program is running in. Within Ubuntu 17.10.

I have uploaded this project here to give you an idea as to how I go about my development process. Make yourself a help and don't copy this code for the purpose of submission. You will be plaguiarising my work. Also a piece of advice, always mention the author, even if you don't copy it completely. ;)
